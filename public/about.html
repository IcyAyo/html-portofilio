<h1>About me! :)</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  I am a 19-year-old computer engineering student from Sudan, currently living
  in Turkey for my studies.<br /><br />
  I grew up with my family in Saudi Arabia, and they’ve always been my biggest
  motivation.<br /><br />
  My goal is to graduate, make them proud, and help out however I can.<br /><br />
  I love diving deep into conversations about games, anime, and life in
  general—I can talk for hours if it’s something I’m passionate about.<br /><br />
  I don’t really have a lot of hobbies, but gaming is something I enjoy when I
  have the time.<br /><br />
  Even though I’m a bit emotional and thoughtful, I try to stay focused on my
  goals, always aiming to become a better version of myself and bring something
  positive to those I care about.
